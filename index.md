  <h2>My Mission</h2>
  <p>   We live in the greatest time of the greatest country in the world. We have near total individual freedom, strongly protected universal human rights, and relative personal protection and safety. Nearly everyone makes enough money to pay bills and save a little, and most make enough to spend plenty of extra having fun. We have heated and cooled housing, lots of clothes, dozens of places to go for food in every neighborhood, and nearly anything can be delivered to us within a couple of days. Not to mention, we have all of human knowledge along with endless options for entertainment collected in our pockets.

  <p>
  However, things are not perfect. In fact, far from it. Despite all of this prosperity, there are lots of big problems that are very common. Certain problems are more common today than ever before. Gen Z, my generation, is experiencing skyrocketing rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation, self-harm, and suicide. Obesity rates are through the roof, every day reveals a new form of addiction, and so many of these problems seem as if they should be perfectly preventable.

  <p>
  So whatâ€™s going on? Why does it seem like so many people are suffering so much when we should be doing so well? Why does the youngest generation seem to be suffering more than any other one before? Even better: what tools do we have that can help us combat this mental health crisis in our lives and in the lives of our loved ones? The content of this website provide some of the answers I found and the places where I found them. For me, these findings were very enlightening, comforting, and encouraging. I hope you as the viewers, especially if you are suffering in any of the ways just mentioned, find some hope as well.

  <p>Sincerely,</p>
