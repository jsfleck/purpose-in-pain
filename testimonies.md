    <h2>Viktor Frankl</h2>
    <p>
      Viktor Frankl was a prominent Austrian Psychiatrist of the 20th century who developed a new field of psychiatric practice he called logotherapy. The basic philosophical premise of logotherapy is that the fundamental drive in the human psyche is not the sex drive as Sigmund Freud believed, or a will to power as Alfred Adler believed, but what he called a “will to meaning,” that being a drive to find the basic purpose in one’s life.

      The Story of Viktor Frankl is especially inspiring because he was also a holocaust survivor. Because of his prestige, he had the opportunity to flee Austria during the development and expansion of Nazi power and control. But he knew that to do so would be to leave his parents to face the inevitable Nazi imprisonment alone. So, he decided to stay. Through tremendous courage and sacrifice, Dr. Frankl was willing to face the unspeakable turmoil he knew was coming. He spent the next three years of his life cycling through four concentration camps, including Auschwitz. Through this torturous experience, he found evidence for his logotherapeutic practice in noting that the people who were most likely to survive the camps were those who could find some sort of meaning or purpose in the midst of it.
