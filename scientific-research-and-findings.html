      <h2>Scientific Research and Findings</h2>
      <p>
        Jonathan Haidt, the primary author of the book “The Coddling of the
        American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas are setting up a
        Generation for Failure” is a modern social psychologist who has written
        several articles and a book concerning Gen Z and the primary problems
        that it faces. This page consists of the terms he has coined and
        collected that help describe what the underlying issues are that are
        leading to the major health crisis of Gen Z. At the bottom of the page
        is a link to his official website for further information.

      <h2>Problems of progress</h2>
      <p>
        These are problems that are seen either solely or disproportionately in
        first world cultures. They are thought to arise uniquely as a
        consequence of hyper development and overabundance. Examples include
        obesity, diabetes, depression, and suicide.
      </p>
      <h2>Concept Creep</h2>
      <p>
        This is a phenomenon in which the definition of a term slowly grows over
        time to include things that were not part of the original definition.
        Haidt points out that this has happened disproportionately with negative
        terms, such as trauma, and this has led to generations that are more
        likely to catastrophize.
      </p>
      <h2>Antifragility</h2>
      <p>
        This term helps illustrate the premise of exposure therapy. Contrary to
        things that are fragile, things that are antifragile grow or strengthen
        through some sort of exposure, testing, or challenging.
      </p>
      <h2>Safetyism</h2>
      <p>
        This is the name for a current cultural phenomenon in which parents
        overly-prioritize protecting their children from harm. In neglect of
        other concerns, such as proper, healthy development, safetyism is
        proving to have long-term, unforeseen consequences.
